# Rules

1.  __**Use common sense!**__ Even if a rule isn't posted here, think before you post. Just because a rule isn't on the list does not mean it's okay. If you know something will get angry responses or reactions, don't do it. The obvious topics are things like like racism, sexism, etc. If you have to ask if something is okay to post, most of the time you probably shouldn't post it.
2.  __**Staff have the final say on issues!**__ If one of the staff tells you to stop doing something, stop, as pushing it will likely make the situation worse. On top of this, minimodding is not appreciated. Do notify staff if you think something requires attention, however.
3.  __**Treat people with respect.**__ This means no flaming, baiting, general trolling, etc. An example would be targeting or harassing a user for their likes or dislikes, character(s) or RP skills. Constructive and respectful criticism is okay, but don't dogpile or mention it if it might exacerbate a situation.
4.  __**Don't advertise or “shill” your server, website, stream, etc.**__ Shilling is defined as posting a link or similar into a chat with zero relevancy whatsoever in an attempt to gain traffic. However, posting a link in chat when it's relevant, or the proper channel for #links_media, is fine.
5.  __**Keep your behavior age appropriate (PG-13).**__ No NSFW content of any kind, whether visual, including cropped porn in chat or on your profile picture, or text, including your status message.
6.  __**Keep your topics light.**__ While going on and venting about your day is acceptable, topics such as suicide, heavy depression, etc. should be kept in DMs. Additionally, bringing in issues or "drama" from other servers is not welcome. This does not mean you can derail or be an asshole to someone who might be doing any of these things. Let the mods deal with it.
7.  __**Respect the channel topic.**__ Each channel has a purpose; please stick to it or move elsewhere. This also means to keep RP in RP channels, and OOC discussion in OOC channels, if possible.
8.  __**Don't abuse the role pings**__ such as @everyone, @here, @Admin, @Moderator, *i.a*. If you spam messages which mention these roles, you may be banned immediately.
9.  __**Keep excessive bot usage in #dice-n-bots.**__ The occasional command and dice roll is fine.
10. __**Have fun!**__ That’s the entire purpose of this server and RPing in general. So… do that.

# RP Code of Conduct

__**Keep your actions reasonable and faithful to the world or scene.**__ “Freeform” doesn’t mean absolute freedom, and actions have consequences. Auto-hits, closed actions, powergaming or unnaturally forcing an action or result onto PCs or NPCs, even your own if implausible, isn’t allowed. More examples include: gaining powers that your character cannot or should not have the ability to learn, inserting yourself into FP1 story events your character has no reason to be a part of (rewriting history) and making canon characters inexplicably have good relationships with their own character for no reason.

__**Respect others’ scenes and characters.**__ Joining scenes set in non-public areas (i.e. not in the park, university, or other public area) without any good reason or permission isn’t permitted. Physical contact should be consensual or agreed to beforehand.

__**Keep it clean.**__ NSFW contact, or anything that might be confused with it at a glance, isn’t permitted under any circumstances. This goes for both player characters and NPCs.

__**Godmodding, powergaming and metagaming are forbidden unless explicitly allowed.**__ ‘Nuff said.

__**Be original.**__ A direct copy-paste of events or characters from an existing franchise, but starring you or others, isn’t cool. Taking inspiration from other things is fine, but don’t rip them off.

__**Fanon isn’t everything.**__ Even if your fanon is accepted by the majority of players, don't expect GMs to include your fanon in their games.

__**Character death:**__ If your character dies, you will be required to reroll a new character for the campaign it was in. Unless, of course, your party pulls off a miracle to bring them back somehow. You can still use the dead character in different campaigns or in freeform, since death doesn’t cross timelines.

__**Character Approval:**__ before you can use a character, it must be approved. If it is your first character, the Player role will not be assigned to you until it is approved. For freeform, post their bio and information in #character_bios using the format posted in #getting_started and wait for two Referees or higher approve it. If your character needs balance or other adjustments, more fleshing out, etc., you will be asked to make the necessary changes. If you want to join an adventure campaign, ask the GM(s) for that campaign. Once approved, you should make a wiki page for your character and, if you don’t have one, yourself.

# Freeform Code of Conduct

__**What is Freeform?**__ In Freeform, there is no GM (unless you designate one). Without one, the RP is guided entirely by the players. If you don't feel comfortable being your own director, then perhaps freeform isn't for you. Because you don't have to just go along with what's happening; In fact, doing that usually makes it boring.

__**Respect the Referees.**__ Their job is to supervise your RP and ensure things don’t get out of hand.

__**If the plot gets too complicated, it should probably be a campaign.**__ If you are trying to play a story with several people that has an uncertain outcome (*e.g.* engaging in a fight with an organization) which is largely dependent on the vision of one person, or if it has a long backlog which is necessary to know about in order to engage with the story, it’s advisable to make a campaign out of it. Freeform isn’t well suited to such stories.

__**Keep your freeform accessible.**__ When roleplaying in a freeform, keep your actions and responses open-ended enough that anyone can engage with them, especially newcomers to the freeform in question. It is fine to talk with specific people in context, but don't be too closed off in your interactions. If anything of significance happened in a scene, before you wrap it up, designate someone to write a summary and post it in #rp-news.

__**Respect the timeline.**__ This server has its own “canon” formed over the last year or so comprising contributions from most, if not all, of its player members. If you start a spinoff or isolated scene, mark it as such to avoid confusion. Keep in mind that if you have a requirement to do this for an extended plot arc, you might want to make it into a full campaign. Characters from formal campaigns are okay to join freeform, but they must meet the other rules. Traits or abilities which depend on another timeline require alternate justification to match the one you want to use them in.

__**You’re not in charge of the world.**__ Actions which involve kidnapping, possessing, hurting, killing, or other harm to other characters must be agreed to beforehand by everyone involved, or they’ll be struck from the timeline. And remember that actions have consequences. It’s very unlikely that you’ll get away with property damage, impersonation, or any other crimes, even in freeform. If you are extremely uncomfortable with something you did, you can ask staff for a retcon, but it might not be granted.

__**Freeform isn't your playground.**__ Using the server for your own wish fulfillment instead of contributing is highly frowned upon. If you want to explore a character concept, the best way to do so is to get involved. You don't need a community to write your own fiction about your character.

# Guidelines

__**Nickname convention:**__ The preferred format is Name1, Name 2 [username/alias]. If you play as more characters than will fit in the character limit, swap in the names of the characters you’re using at the current time and, optionally, append (+n) where n is the number of additional characters you have. Example: Wade, Seth, Abby (+3) [Parzival].

__**IC message formatting convention:**__ Dialogue goes in quotes: “like this.” If you need to speak out of character, use parenthesis/strikethrough on each end, (like this) or \~\~~~like this~~\~\~. The most common method of differentiating speech and action is to put the action \**in italics*\*. Quotes in italics are used for when a character is thinking to itself. \*\***Bold**\*\* can be used for yelling or pointing something out. Telepathy or text messages usually go in \``code blocks`\`.

__**Keep character growth within their original concept.**__ A character is never done changing, because that's just how character development works. What many people don't understand is that when people say that, they're referring to skills and personalities. Characters continue to grow and change in the same way people grow and change, through experiences, decisions, and hard work, but they can’t change their base concepts any more than actual people can. When you tack on new abilities, skills and properties to characters that don't have any place in the original concept of the character, it comes across as lazily done wish fulfillment—because it almost always is. So don't do that. Instead, make a new character and implement your desired changes properly, complete with a backstory and new personality.

__**Don’t miss scheduled sessions without notice.**__ A GM can set their own rules regarding attendance, and those are what will be enforced. Here are some example rules we have come up for GMs to use:
- If you cannot make it to a scheduled session, give the GM at least a day's notice.
- If you do have to miss a session on shorter notice, give the group a heads up so the GM has some time to make any necessary adjustments.
- If you request a time or time restrictions on when the group can convene, ensure that you can make that time.
  - If you miss one of these special sessions without warning, this counts as two breaches.
- A player who breaches these guidelines three times may be asked to leave the campaign.

__**Overpowered characters:**__ unreasonable levels of power such as Chaos Control, time manipulation, unlimited magical power, etc. are highly discouraged. You might be asked to nerf or limit anything that is seen as overpowered by staff.

__**Wiki Usage:**__ to keep track of everything in a way that everyone can explore and contribute to, Avalice Online uses Wikia. Characters, campaigns and non-canonical places should have a page to be considered an official part of the server. You may use characters and start campaigns before a page is fully complete, but you should at least have a page containing an overview. Several templates and infobox types are provided for your convenience.

# Bot Usage

- **Dice:** the !dice command supports many operators, which are listed [here](https://github.com/borntyping/python-dice/blob/master/README.rst#notation).
- **Scenes:** !srp, !erp, !prp, !rrp are for marking when you start, end, pause and resume a scene.
  - !srs and !ers are variants which serve the same role but are targeted at campaigns.

# Punishment

**Timeouts** are handed out when people break the rules, and prevent you from speaking in all channels except #basement. This allows the staff to have a one-on-one conversation with you, and for appropriate punishment to be given. Being put in Timeout is not always for punishment; it may also be used just to tell you to calm down. Being uncooperative can also make things worse, and leaving/rejoining while in timeout will both a) not work and b) make things worse for you.

**Warnings:** Avalice Online uses a single Warning system. Warnings expire after 30 days. If you receive another warning while the first is still active, you will be banned. If you are put in timeout while on warning, the discussion will likely revolve around a ban. To help with reminding you of being on warning, this role comes with complimentary bright yellow paint.

**Ban appeals** are handled on a case by case basis, and are submitted by contacting a staff member. For an appeal to be considered, the user must have:
  1) Remain banned for at least two weeks.
  2) Not have been banned for raiding, spamming, or posting NSFW.
  3) Not have used an alt to evade the ban.
  4) Not have previously been unbanned on appeal.

When a user is unbanned on appeal, they start with a warning which replaces any they might have had before.
