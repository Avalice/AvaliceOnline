## What is Avalice Online?
In August 2016, some goofball named Dazl created the Crystal Cafe, a server for small-scale Freedom Planet RP. As time passed, its membership grew, and a handful of tabletop campaigns started.

In July 2017, it was rebranded to Avalice Online to fit its nature as both a freeform and multi-campaign group (it also sounds more like a MMORPG). Shortly afterwards, Dazl transferred ownership to its current owner, Caleb, and began a self-imposed hiatus from most social media for personal reasons. We welcome the day when he returns.

After the transfer, new rules were written, more staff were selected from applicants, and the server's channels and roles were reorganized into what they are now.

Currently, Avalice Online is the only known freeform and multi-campaign Freedom Planet roleplay community. We also have many of the same standards as, and share some staff with, the official GalaxyTrail community server.

## What is the world like?
(WIP)

## How do I get started here?
__For FFRP__, as stated in #rules, post your character's bio and information in #character_bios and wait for two staff members to approve. Note that characters with more detail and which show more thought put into them are more likely to be approved. Your post should contain the following information, or a link to a document with it. Fields marked with an asterisk are required.
```
Character name*: (Your character's full name and how you want them be called)
Race/Species*: (Which anthro animal or alien species they are)
Gender*: 
Element*: 
Character age / Date of Birth: 
Place of Birth: 
Planet/Universe of Origin*: (If not native to Avalice)
Height / Weight: 
Character Appearance*: (Required, unless you have a pic handy.)
Character Strengths and Weaknesses: (Keep it balanced)
Special Skills and Abilities*: (Doctor, ace pilot, etc; or if they have any abilities, which level?)
Bio / Personality: 
Backstory: 
Other Info: (Anything that doesn't fit into the previous fields)
```

__Campaigns__ are a different matter. To join one, first confirm that the campaign is open for new party members. If it is, work with the GM(s) to write or port your new or existing character to the system being used.

__Spectating__ is another option. To mark yourself as someone who's just here to watch things as they happen and not play just yet, go to #dice-n-bots and type `!spectate`. This will prevent you from being kicked due to inactivity.

## What should I keep in mind when making a new character?
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and most of us have more weaknesses than strengths. Those we think of as great figures are no different, but they learned their weaknesses, slowly overcame them, and developed their strengths, all through hard work. It's the same whatever world you're in, and no matter what level of technology or magic is present: being a professional adult is hard work.

Remember: Your character is, in many ways, just one performer in an ongoing symphony Even the most talented among us can't become true jacks of all trades without decades of practice, so either narrow your focus and find one thing your character truly loves to do; or don't, and play with them having numerous interests but nothing in particular they excel in.

Another thing: sometimes a character can be written with an interesting and unique concept, but still fall flat when used. Why? For any character to be believable they need to have more than just mannerisms, habits, hobbies, or skills. They should also have ideals, ambitions, ways of thinking, and long term goals that all work together to drive them and make them who they are. These are sometimes called Core Motivations, and people can have any number of them. For a character to feel believable, a good rule is that they should have at least three in play at any given time.

For example: Carol Tea’s Core Motivations might be "rather a traitor than a murderer", the belief that upholding morals is more important than completing a task or preserving your social standing; "I just want to hang out with my best friends", representing her persistently playful and not always serious nature; and "teenage gang biker" for her goals: become rich, become famous, and collect even more sweet rides. A code of conduct, something that describes her visible personality, and her future ambitions.

More suggestions can be found [here](http://avalice.wikia.com/wiki/).

## How do I keep up with everything?
__To keep track of important things in a way that everyone can explore and contribute to, we use the [Avalice Online Wiki](http://avalice.wikia.com/).__ Characters, campaigns, and important non-canonical places or events should all be documented there in order to be considered an official part of the server. Currently, all users are required to log in to Wikia before contributing. This means no anonymous edits.

We also use a public spreadsheet to keep a record of notable [FFRP events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qyzy9MOvJmWzLdG3VL_auihIjWVUB6AwddwFV-D01gc/edit#gid=0).

### Do I have to read and keep track of EVERYTHING?
Not at all! You should only keep up with important things that affect or shape your characters, plot, and the world in general. Unless you *really* want to document what they had for breakfast every day…

### Creating a Player page
Your wiki-specific user page will be located at <http://avalice.wikia.com/wiki/User:YOUR_USERNAME>. Use this as your player page. Most player pages are relatively simple and easy to copy and adapt for new players. Simply go to edit another player's page and use the **Classic editor** to copy its source into yours before making the necessary changes.

If not copied, you need to insert a Player infobox __first__, and fill out the necessary details. For the `time` field, put `{{Time widget|<YOUR TIMEZONE CODE>}}`. Then add text to the rest of the article using the editor. The most important section is **Characters**, which will contain a list of your characters. Make them `[[links]]` to the desired page name, as the page need not exist to make a link. You will create your character pages next.

It is also permissible to create a **redirect** page for an alias. Example [here](http://avalice.wikia.com/wiki/Alestance?redirect=no).

### Creating a Character Page
Follow the instructions on [this page](http://avalice.wikia.com/wiki/Character_Creation).

## What is Freeform?
__In Freeform, there is no GM.__ In other words, the RP is guided entirely by the players. If you don't feel comfortable being your own director, then perhaps freeform isn't for you. Because you don't have to just go along with what's happening; In fact, doing that usually makes it boring.

## How should I grow my character?
__Through experiences, decisions, and hard work, just like in real life.__ These can be part of scenes, or done offscreen, within reason. A character is never done changing, because that's just how character development works. What many people don't understand is that when people say that, they're referring to skills and personalities. Characters continue to grow and change in the same way people grow and change, but they can’t change their base concepts any more than actual people can. So don't tack on new abilities, skills and properties that don't have any place in the original concept of the character, it comes across as lazily done wish fulfillment—because it almost always is. So don't do that. Instead, make a new character and implement your desired changes properly, complete with a backstory and new personality.

## What's considered "overpowered"?
__Overpowered characters have unreasonably powerful abilities__ such as Chaos Control, time manipulation, unlimited magical power, Jumper-style universal teleportation, etc., are generally prohibited. You might be asked to nerf or limit anything that is seen as overpowered by staff.

## What's the nickname convention?
__The preferred format is `Character1, Character2 [username/alias]`.__ If you play as more characters than will fit in the character limit (32), swap in the names of the characters you’re using at the current time and, optionally, append (+n) where n is the number of additional characters you have. Example: `Wade, Seth, Abby (+3) [Parzival]`.

## What about RP style conventions?
__Write however you want, but please stick to one style for the duration of a scene.__ If you're not sure, or don't have a favorite style, the following is commonly used and easy to understand:

Dialogue goes in quotes: “like this.” If you need to speak out of character, use parenthesis on each end, (like this).

To specify an action, put it \**in italics*\*. Quotes in italics are used for when a character is thinking to themself.

\*\***Bold**\*\* can be used for yelling or otherwise emphasizing something.

Telepathy or text messages usually go in backticks to make it \``monospace`\` or triple backticks to make it a
```
code block.
```

## Where can I ask other questions or make suggestions?
__In general, you can always DM a staff member__, but you'll probably get a faster response by asking in a public channel.

If you have any questions about character design, writing, or RPing in general, drop a question in #tutor_chat.

If you have a general server question, ask it in #server_qa.

Finally, if you have a suggestion for the server, post it in #suggestion_box.
